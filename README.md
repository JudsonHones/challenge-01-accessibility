# <Challenge-01-Accessibility>

## Description

Changed an already existing set of code for a website to be accessible and cleaned up elements within the HTML as to make it easier to read. This project helped a lot with teaching me how HTML and CSS interact with each other in different ways it also taught me how to better format my code.
